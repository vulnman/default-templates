A directory listing vulnerability means that the webserver lists the contents of its directories, allowing the attacker to easily browse all the files within the affected directories.
Often, this causes sensitive files to be exposed to the world, such as internal reports, logs, backups and even the source code of the application.

Directory listing is a feature of the webserver, that can help users browse the content of a web site, much like an FTP server or a shared folder.
There are legitimate reasons to have this feature enabled, but more frequently it is enabled inadvertently, typically because it is the default web server configuration.
You should consider disabling it for the entire application, thus ensuring that no existing directories (or future ones) are vulnerable.
