The application should be configured to use encryption in all communications.
This normally means to configure the service to use TLS with a suitable choice of ciphers, forcing all incoming requests in plaintext (without encryption) to be redirected to TLS endpoint of the application.

In HTTP this is achieved with a 301 Moved Permanently directive.
It can be complemented with an HTTP Strict Transport Security header (HSTS) to force the browsers to make all requests in HTTPS even if the end user forgets to write HTTPS in the request.
