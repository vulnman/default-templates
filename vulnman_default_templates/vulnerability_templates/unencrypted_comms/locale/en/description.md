The application allows clients to connect to it through an unencrypted connection, meaning that an attacker that is strategically positioned between the victim's and the applications's traffic is able to eavesdrop all communications between them, accessing any information that is being transmitted, such as the victim's credentials.
In addition, the attacker can modify the communications to deliver more powerful attacks, for instance, to ask the victim for more sensitive information that hasn't been asked in the original application page.

Such attacks are more likely to occur when the victim is using an insecure Wi-Fi connection, a typical scenario in the public Wi-Fi services.
