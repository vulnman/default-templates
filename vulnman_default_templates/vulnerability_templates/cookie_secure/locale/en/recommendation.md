To fix a vulnerability of this type, you just need to set the Secure flag on the vulnerable cookie, effectively preventing it from being transmitted in unencrypted connections, i.e. over HTTP.

Depending on the language and technologies you are using, setting the Secure flag could mean to enable it or setting it to true, either on the code of the application itself or in a configuration file of the webserver or Content Management System (CMS) you are using.
