The cookie secure flag is intended to prevent browsers from submitting the cookie in any HTTP requests that use an unencrypted connection, thus an attacker that is eavesdropping the connection will not be able to get that cookie.

A flag without the secure flag set will always be sent on every HTTP request that matches the scope of cookie, i.e. the domain for which it is set.
What this means is that if your application inadvertently makes an HTTP request (without encryption), this request will carry the cookie and any attacker that can eavesdrop the victim traffic will be able to read that cookie.

If the cookie in question is the session cookie, the attacker will be able to hijack the victim account.
