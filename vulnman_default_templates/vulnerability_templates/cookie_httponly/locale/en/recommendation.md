To fix a vulnerability of this type, you just need to set the HttpOnly flag on the vulnerable cookie, effectively preventing it from being read by client side scripts.

Depending on the language and technologies you are using, setting the HttpOnly flag could mean to enable it or setting it to true, either on the code of the application itself or in a configuration file of the webserver or Content Management System (CMS) you are using.
