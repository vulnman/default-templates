SQL Injections are the most common form of injections because SQL databases are very popular in dynamic web applications.
This vulnerability allows an attacker to tamper existing SQL queries performed by the web application.
Depending on the queries, the attacker might be able to access, modify or even destroy data from the database.

Since databases are commonly used to store private data, such as authentication information, personal user data and site content, if an attacker gains access to it, the consequences are typically very severe, ranging from defacement of the web application to users data leakage or loss, or even full control of the web application or database server.
