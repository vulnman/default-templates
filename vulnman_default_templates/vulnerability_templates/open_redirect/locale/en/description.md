The Open Redirection vulnerability occurs because it is possible to force the application to do an HTTP redirect to an arbitrary domain, chosen by the attacker.

The attacker can construct a URL to the application that, when visited, redirects the victim to the attacker site.
Because the first request is made to a legitimate domain, it can be leveraged to create realistic and successful phishing attacks, since users will trust the URL and will likely not notice the redirect to the malicious domain.
This technique is also useful to bypass security controls that look for malicious domains in URLs.
